# Machine Learning Implementations

1. Project 1:
   Implementation of KNN, MLE and Naive Bayes Classifiers. Implemented the classifiers for below problem statements.
   Problem Statement: 
   1. Predict two year recidivism on COMPAS dataset
   2. Handwritten digit classification.

2. city_coordinate_estimation.ipnyb:
   Estimation of city coordinates based on distance from each other
   Optimization function estimates the city coordinates by minimizing the difference between estimated city coordinates 
   and actual distance between them.

3. Kernelized_Kmeans:
   Implementation of Lloyd's method to cluster data.
   Implementation of Kernelized Lloyd's method to cluster data.
