# Machine Learning Implementations

1. Project 1:
   Implementation of KNN, MLE and Naive Bayes Classifiers. Implemented the classifiers for below problem statements.
   Problem Statement: 
   1. Predict two year recidivism on COMPAS dataset
   2. Handwritten digit classification.

2. city_coordinate_estimation.ipnyb:
   Estimation of city coordinates based on distance from each other
   Optimization function estimates the city coordinates by minimizing the difference between estimated city coordinates 
   and actual distance between them.
